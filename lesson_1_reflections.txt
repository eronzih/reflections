Q: How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

Human makes mistake, and we did it most of the time. We always thought what we did was right, 
but in the end we always end up looking for mistakes that we thought was right.


Q : How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Because human has a very limited memory, and remembering what has changes is very time consuming,
so, have a overview of the history of file could save alot of time.


Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Giving much flexibility is good, but makeing decision is one of the weakness of being human.
Deciding when to commit a change is quite chalaging sometimes, but sometime is people will being lazy
example, we decided to do 1 commit in two logical changes.

Pro: every commit contains meaningful changes
Cons: each commit might not be quite standards


Q : Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Git allow to saving multiple files in one commit is because it was design for source code version control,  
and usually not all sourse code are written in one file, they may be in a project contains many many files.
Hence, Google Docs are design for writing rich text documents that doesn't link with others files to makes sense.


Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?



Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?


Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
